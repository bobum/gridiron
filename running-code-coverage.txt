Running Code Coverage

  Run your tests with code coverage collection:

  dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

  This will generate coverage files in the TestResults folder.

  Generating HTML Reports

  To see which lines are covered/uncovered, you'll want to install
  ReportGenerator as a global tool:

  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

  Then generate an HTML report from the coverage data:

  reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml"
  -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html

  After running this, open coveragereport/index.html in your browser
  to see:
  - Overall coverage percentage
  - Coverage by project/file
  - Line-by-line highlighting showing which lines are covered (green)
  and not covered (red)

  Quick Command to Run Both

  You can chain these commands together:

  dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" && reportgenerator
  -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport"
  -reporttypes:Html
